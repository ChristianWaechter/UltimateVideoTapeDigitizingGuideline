# Ultimate video tape digitizing guideline for dummies

This is the ultimate guide for digitizing video tapes like (S-)VHS, Video8, Hi8, Betamax and similar! This will be the last guide you will ever read! It will cover some of the most common solutions, from the worst method 0 (that should never ever be done and is only included as bad-reference) to the best but most complex with some variants in between.

*Currently work in progress and more of a brainstorming platform*

If you want and contribute to this HowTo, feel free to do so :)

## Background information

TODO: Describe signal flow: Analog (magnetic) signal on tape > read by VCR (heads) > processing of these electrical signals > conversion to analog TV signal (S-Video/Composite) > convertion to digital signal > saving to a movie file on a PC


## Method 0 - how to waste your time with cheep video grabbers
**Avoid this method at all cost! This is only included to show and describe what should NOT be done! Even though it might be good for you to read through this method to know what to avoid**

Unfortunatelly most of the "video digitizing solutions" that are well advertised and can easily be bought online for ~100 â‚¬/$ belong into this category. They offer a simple but mostly destructive software and a cheap video grabber. Therefore the quality that is to be expected will be poor in most cases. So this is not only a waste of time, but also a waste of money and of your precious tape, if it already degraded and is on the border to unreadable.



## Method 1 - Gubel Method with Panasonic DVD-Recorder

## Method 2a - Digitizing with a serious video grabber 


## Method 2b - Digitizing with a serious video tape player/recorder with integrated TBC

If you do not know whether you should go with this or the previos method, go with the previos method. Even though it might be hard and expensive to find a serious video grabber, it might be even harder to find a serious video tape player/recorder with an integrated TBC that is actually working fine!
